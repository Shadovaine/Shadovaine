/bin directory
  
Stands for binary ( compiled programs)
   System directory contains essential executable programs needed to boot system and run basic commands

Why is /bin separate from /usr/bin?
	•	/bin: Must-have commands for the system to start and run.
	•	/usr/bin: Non-essential programs used once the system is fully up. (e.g., text editors, compilers, user utilities).

In modern systems, some distros symlink /bin to /usr/bin to simplify things.

What lives in /bin
Binary	What It Does
bash	The Bourne Again SHell (your command interpreter)
ls	Lists directory contents
cp	Copies files and directories
mv	Moves/renames files and directories
rm	Removes files or directories
cat	Concatenates and displays file content
echo	Prints text to the terminal
pwd	Prints the current working directory
chmod	Changes file permissions
ln	Creates links (hard or symbolic)

/sbin directory
  
Stands for “system binaries”
  It contains essential system administration programs that are primarily used by the root (superuser) for managing and repairing the system.
	•	These commands are needed for tasks like mounting drives, repairing filesystems, networking setup, or rebooting the system.

Think of it as the “admin’s toolbox” for running and fixing the system.

What lives in /sbin
Binary	What It Does
fsck	Checks and repairs filesystems
mount	Mounts filesystems
umount	Unmounts filesystems
ifconfig	Configures network interfaces (deprecated for ip)
reboot	Reboots the system
shutdown	Powers down the system
init	Initializes the system (parent of all processes)
iptables	Configures firewall rules
mkfs	Builds a filesystem on a device

/etc directory

•	/etc stands for “editable text configuration” (that’s the unofficial but easy way to remember).
	•	It’s the central hub for system-wide configuration files.
	•	This is where Linux and installed software keep their settings, preferences, and startup scripts.

📍 Located in the root directory (/), because the system needs it even in single-user mode.

What lives in /etc
File/Folder	What It Does
passwd	Stores user account information (but not passwords!)
shadow	Stores encrypted user passwords
hosts	Maps hostnames to IP addresses locally
fstab	Lists filesystems to mount at boot
hostname	Sets the system’s hostname
resolv.conf	Configures DNS servers
network/	Network configuration files
init.d/	Startup scripts for services (older systems)
systemd/	Service unit files for systemd (newer systems)
ssh/	SSH configuration (client & server keys/settings)

Why is /etc so important?

✅ This is where you and the system admins tweak how Linux behaves:
	•	Add new users
	•	Configure networking
	•	Set which services start at boot
	•	Secure your system (like configuring SSH in /etc/ssh/sshd_config)

🛡️ If you screw up something in /etc, your system might not boot or network correctly. That’s why experienced sysadmins back up /etc before making big changes.

File/Folder	What It Does
passwd	Stores user account information (but not passwords!)
shadow	Stores encrypted user passwords
hosts	Maps hostnames to IP addresses locally
fstab	Lists filesystems to mount at boot
hostname	Sets the system’s hostname
resolv.conf	Configures DNS servers
network/	Network configuration files
init.d/	Startup scripts for services (older systems)
systemd/	Service unit files for systemd (newer systems)
ssh/	SSH configuration (client & server keys/settings)


Real-World Examples
	•	Edit /etc/hostname → Change your computer’s name.
	•	Edit /etc/hosts → Block websites (like a local ad-blocker).
	•	Edit /etc/fstab → Automatically mount a USB drive at boot.
	•	Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config → Harden SSH for cybersecurity.

Where does /etc fit

Directory	Purpose	Example Task
/bin	Core user commands	Run ls, cp, mv
/sbin	Core admin tools	Run fsck, mount
/usr/bin	Installed software for users	Run python3, git
/usr/sbin	Installed admin tools	Run sshd, iptables
/etc	System-wide configuration	Edit ssh, fstab, passwd

/etc/passwd file
   
Stores basic information about every user
       Each file contains:
              Username, User ID (UID), Group ID ( GID), Home Directory, Shell

Passwords are not in /etc/passwd they are in.  /etc/shadow… which is more restricted.

Example: 
Jake: x : 1001 : 1001 : Jake welly: /home/jake:/bin/bash

   Jake = username
   X = password placeholder ( actual password is in /etc/shadow)
   1001 = userID
   1001 = groupID
    /home/jake = home directory
    /bin/bash = default shell

Field	Value	What it means
1. Username	jake	Login name. Used when you type ssh jake@hostname or su jake.
2. Password	x	Placeholder. Password hashes are stored securely in /etc/shadow.
3. User ID (UID)	1001	Unique ID for this user. UID 0 = root, 1-999 = system users.
4. Group ID (GID)	1001	Primary group for this user (from /etc/group).
5. User Info	Jake Welly	Comment field (aka GECOS). Often used for the full name.
6. Home Directory	/home/jake	Path to user’s home folder.
7. Shell	/bin/bash	Default shell when user logs in.

/var directory

What is it?
	•	/var stands for “variable data.”
	•	It contains files and data that change frequently while the system is running.
	•	Unlike /etc (static configs), /var is dynamic—it grows and shrinks as your system operates.

📍 Located in the root directory (/).

What lives in /var
Directory	What It Does
/var/log	System logs (kernel, authentication, errors, etc.)
/var/spool	Holds queued tasks (like print jobs and mail)
/var/cache	Application cache files
/var/tmp	Temporary files kept between reboots
/var/lib	State information for programs (databases, package info)
/var/mail	Stores user mailboxes
/var/run → /run	Holds process ID files (like services tracking info)

Why is /var important 

It’s where Linux keeps all its “changing state” data:
	•	Logs for auditing and troubleshooting.
	•	Cached downloads to speed things up.
	•	Queued tasks for printers or cron jobs.

🛡️ If /var fills up, your system can crash. For example, if log files in /var/log grow too big, you might not be able to log in.

Real world examples 
Check /var/log/auth.log → See failed login attempts (great for cybersecurity).
	•	Clear /var/cache/apt → Free up space from downloaded packages.
	•	Look in /var/spool/cron → Inspect user cron jobs.
	•	Monitor /var/lib/mysql → Database data lives here.

 /home directory

What is it?
	•	/home is where Linux stores personal files and settings for each user on the system.
	•	Every user gets their own subdirectory under /home.
	•	It’s like each user’s private workshop inside the larger house.

📍 Example:
If your username is jake, your personal directory is: /home/jake

What lives on /home
File/Folder	What It Does
Documents/	User’s text docs, PDFs, etc.
Downloads/	Files downloaded from the internet
Desktop/	Files and shortcuts shown on the desktop environment
Pictures/	User’s images
Videos/	User’s videos
Music/	User’s audio files
.bashrc	Hidden config for bash shell customization
.ssh/	User’s SSH keys and configs
.config/	App configuration files

Anything with a dot (.) is hidden (like .bashrc) but critical for custom setups.

This is your world on Linux:
	•	Personal files and settings stay isolated.
	•	You can experiment freely without messing with the system’s core files.
	•	Great for multi-user systems—each user’s space is separate.

🛡️ Admins can back up /home to save all user data without touching system files.

Real world examples 

Edit your .bashrc to customize your prompt and aliases.
	•	Store your TryHackMe reports and code projects in /home/jake/Documents/cybersecurity.
	•	Place your SSH keys in /home/jake/.ssh/ for secure server access.

/root directory 

What is it?
	•	/root is the home directory of the root user (superuser).
	•	It’s like the private lair of the dragon king—reserved only for the most powerful entity in the system.
	•	Not to be confused with / (the root of the filesystem).

File/Folder	What It Does
.bashrc	Root’s custom bash shell configuration
.ssh/	SSH keys for root-only remote access
scripts/	Admin’s personal scripts for maintenance
backups/	Critical system backup files
log_check.sh	A script for scanning logs for security breaches

Regular users cannot access this directory without root privileges (sudo or su).

Why is /root Important?

✅ It exists to give the root user:
	•	A safe, separate workspace from normal users.
	•	A place to manage emergency system repairs.
	•	Configurations isolated from regular user profiles.

📝 If the system is in single-user mode or you’ve booted into rescue, /root is where you’ll land as the superuser.

Root va regular users
Feature	Regular User	Root User
Home Directory	/home/jake	/root
Privileges	Limited	Full control (all-powerful)
Can Edit System Files?	❌ No	✅ Yes
Can Wreck the System?	❌ No	✅ Oh yes—be careful

Real-World Examples
	•	Use sudo su → Enter root’s domain.
	•	Edit /root/.bashrc to set up root-specific aliases (like alias ll='ls -lah').
	•	Store sensitive system-wide scripts in /root/scripts/.

What is an alias in Linux?

An alias is like a shortcut or nickname for a longer command. Instead of typing something like:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y


every time you want to update your system, you can create an alias:

alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'


Why are aliases important?

1. Speed
	•	Saves keystrokes and time, especially for commands you type often.

✅ 2. Safety
	•	Prevents costly typos. Example:
Instead of typing rm -rf /path/to/something, you can create a safer alias:
         alias rm='rm -i'

The -i flag asks before deleting files. (This has saved countless beginners from nuking their systems.)

3. Customization
	•	Tailor your terminal to match your workflow. Hackers and sysadmins often create aliases for pentesting tools, log monitoring, or jumping into certain directories.

✅ 4. Readability
	•	Makes complex commands easier to remember and share.

When should you set one up?

You set up an alias when:
🕒 A. You use a command frequently
	•	Example: ls -alh is long to type, so make alias ll='ls -alh'.

🚨 B. You want safer defaults
	•	Example: alias cp='cp -i' to make cp interactive, asking before overwriting files.

🎨 C. You’re customizing your shell environment

Example: A developer might do:

alias serve='python3 -m http.server'

so they can start a web server with one word.

How to set up an alias

1️⃣ Temporary (lasts only in current session):

alias gs='git status'

Permanent (loads every time you open terminal):
Edit your shell config file (~/.bashrc for bash, ~/.zshrc for zsh):

nano ~/.bashrc

Add this line at the bottom:

alias gs='git status'

Save and reload:

source ~/.bashrc

Examples of Useful Aliases

alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'
alias cls='clear'
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias h='history'

Hacker Mindset Tip:
Red-teamers use aliases to create quick commands for common tasks like scanning (alias scan='nmap -sV -Pn') or to hide their tracks. But as a defender, you can use them to automate monitoring tools and harden systems.

Dragon Wisdom About /root
	•	🛡️ It’s dangerous: Mistakes made as root can brick your system.
	•	🗝️ It’s powerful: Essential for sysadmin work and cybersecurity tasks.
	•	👑 It’s yours when wearing the root crown: But only put it on when you know what you’re doing.

/usr Directory

What is it?
	•	/usr/bin contains user binaries—programs and commands that are not required to boot the system but are used once it’s fully operational.
	•	These are the day-to-day tools you use to work, write code, edit files, or run applications.

📍 Located in /usr, which stands for “user system resources.”

/usr/bin and /usr/sbin

What lives in /usr/bin
Binary	What It Does
python3	Runs Python 3 programs
gcc	GNU Compiler Collection (compiles C/C++ code)
nano	Simple text editor
git	Version control system
tar	Archives/compresses files
wget	Downloads files from the internet
curl	Transfers data from or to a server

What is /usr/sbin

What is it?
	•	/usr/sbin contains system admin binaries for managing advanced system services and configurations.
	•	These are non-essential at boot, but critical for configuring servers, networking, and security.
	•	Usually only the root user or sudoers can run these.

What lives in /usr/sbin

Binary	What It Does
sshd	Secure Shell daemon (allows SSH connections)
apache2	Apache web server binary
useradd	Adds new user accounts
groupadd	Adds new groups
iptables	Configures firewall rules
tcpdump	Captures network packets for analysis

📌 If you’re setting up servers or doing cybersecurity hardening, you’ll spend a lot of time here.

How they fit together
Directory	Who Uses It?	What’s Inside?
/usr/bin	All users	Programs like python3, git, nano
/usr/sbin	System admins (root)	Daemons & admin tools like sshd, iptables

Directory	Essential for Boot?	User or Root?	Example Commands
/bin	✅ Yes	All users	ls, cp, mv
/sbin	✅ Yes	Root/admin only	fsck, mount
/usr/bin	❌ No	All users	python3, git
/usr/sbin	❌ No	Root/admin only	sshd, iptables

/usr/local/bin

What is it?
	•	/usr/local/bin is for user-installed binaries (programs and scripts).
	•	This directory is not touched by the package manager (apt, yum, etc.), so it’s safe for custom installations.
	•	Commands in here are typically user-level tools that don’t require root to run.

📍 Located in /usr/local, which is reserved for “local” custom software on your system.


What lives here
Example Binary	What It Does
my_script.sh	A custom shell script you created
node	Node.js binary installed manually
go	Golang binary (if installed from source)
custom-tool	Any utility installed outside package manager

If you install software manually with make && make install, it usually ends up here.

/usr/local/sbin

What is it?
	•	/usr/local/sbin is the admin-only version of /usr/local/bin.
	•	Used for system administrator programs that you’ve compiled or installed yourself.
	•	Commands in here usually require root or sudo to run.

Example Binary	What It Does
custom-daemon	A custom service you compiled and installed
vpn-setup-tool	A manually installed VPN admin utility
my_backup_tool	Your own backup script running as root

The big picture
Directory	Managed By?	Who Uses It?	What’s Inside?
/bin	OS	All users	Core commands (ls, cp, etc.)
/sbin	OS	Root/admin only	Core admin tools (fsck, mount)
/usr/bin	Package Manager	All users	Installed software (python3, nano)
/usr/sbin	Package Manager	Root/admin only	Installed admin tools (sshd, apache2)
/usr/local/bin	You (manual install)	All users	Custom binaries/scripts
/usr/local/sbin	You (manual install)	Root/admin only	

opt directory

What is it?
	•	/opt stands for “optional.”
	•	It’s a directory designed to hold add-on application software packages that aren’t part of the base OS.
	•	Think of it like the “VIP room” for third-party apps.

📍 Located at the root level (/), separate from system binaries and configs.

What lives in /opt
Example	What It Does
/opt/google/	Google Chrome installed manually
/opt/vmware/	VMware Workstation binaries and libraries
/opt/zoom/	Zoom client installed outside package manager
/opt/myapp/	Your custom app installed manually

Packages installed here often come with their own binaries, libraries, and configs, keeping them isolated from system files.


Why Use /opt?

✅ For third-party or custom software:
	•	Keeps your system’s core directories (/bin, /usr/bin) clean.
	•	Prevents conflicts with OS updates or package manager upgrades.
	•	Useful for enterprise apps and manual installations.

📌 Sysadmins love this directory for managing large, self-contained software suites.

Real-World Examples
	•	You download a .tar.gz of a custom security tool, extract it, and install it in /opt/mytool/.
	•	A company installs Oracle software in /opt/oracle/.
	•	Games like Steam (if manually installed) often go here.

Dragon Wisdom About /opt
	•	Good for cybersecurity tools: Pen-testing apps like Burp Suite, Nessus, or custom scripts often live here when installed manually.
	•	Avoids “dependency hell”: Since apps in /opt bring their own dependencies, they don’t break when you update the system.

/lib directory

What is it?
	•	/lib stands for “library”.
	•	It holds shared libraries and kernel modules needed by programs in /bin and /sbin to run.
	•	These libraries are like the magical incantations that make your commands actually work.

📍 Located in the root filesystem (/), because it’s essential for system booting.

What lives in /lib
Directory/File	What It Does
libc.so.*	The GNU C library (the core library for Linux)
ld-linux.so.*	Dynamic linker/loader
modules/	Kernel modules (*.ko files)
systemd/	Libraries needed for system initialization
libm.so.*	Math library

Shared libraries here usually have names like:
LibXYZ.so.1

lib → It’s a library.
   •	so → Stands for “shared object.”
	•	The version number at the end (like .1) matters for compatibility.

Why is /lib important

It’s critical for system booting and running basic binaries.
	•	Without /lib, binaries in /bin and /sbin wouldn’t work because they rely on these libraries.
	•	Kernel modules here let Linux interact with hardware (drivers for devices like USB, networking, etc.).

🛡️ If you accidentally delete /lib, your system becomes unbootable.

Real-World Examples
	•	Dynamic Linking: When you run ls, it calls libraries in /lib (like libc.so).
	•	Kernel Modules: Load extra hardware support by pulling modules from /lib/modules/.

Troubleshooting: If a program complains about “missing shared library,” check /lib.

On 64-bit systems, you’ll also see:
	•	/lib64: Libraries specifically for 64-bit binaries.

Dragon Wisdom About /lib
	•	🪄 It’s the system’s magic: Without it, binaries are useless shells.
	•	🧑‍💻 Cybersecurity tip: Attackers sometimes replace /lib libraries with malicious ones (called library hijacking).


/proc directory 

What is it?
	•	/proc stands for “process.”
	•	It’s a virtual filesystem (not stored on disk) that provides a window into the kernel and running processes.
	•	Think of it as the control room where Linux displays real-time information about the system.

Mounted automatically at boot under:
/proc

What lives in /proc
File/Folder	What It Represents
cpuinfo	Details about the CPU (model, cores, speed)
meminfo	RAM usage statistics
uptime	How long the system has been running
version	Kernel version information
mounts	Mounted filesystems
cmdline	Kernel boot parameters
[PID]/	Subdirectories for each running process by their PID
kallsyms	Kernel symbol table
sys/	Kernel tunables (used by sysctl)

What’s So Special About /proc?

✅ It’s dynamic: Data in /proc is generated on-the-fly by the kernel every time you access it.
✅ It’s read-only for most files, but some files (like /proc/sys) can be modified to change kernel parameters in real-time.

🛡️ This is why /proc is vital for system monitoring, debugging, and tuning.

Real world examples 

See CPU Details:

cat /proc/cpuinfo

Check Memory Usage:

cat /proc/meminfo

List all running processes (by PID):

ls /proc | grep '^[0-9]

Tweak Kernel Settings (as root):

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

View Kernel Version:

cat /proc/version


How /proc Powers Cybersecurity
	•	🛡️ Monitor system activity: Watch process behavior during an incident.
	•	🧑‍💻 Forensics: Inspect /proc/[PID]/cmdline to see what commands a process ran.
	•	⚙️ Hardening: Adjust kernel security flags via /proc/sys.

Dragon Wisdom About /proc
	•	🪄 It’s like reading the system’s live neural network.
	•	🛡️ Some files in /proc/sys can literally change system behavior—so handle with care.
	•	🧑‍💻 As a cybersecurity pro, you’ll visit /proc often to monitor or control processes.

/Dev directory

What is /dev?
	•	/dev is the directory that contains device files (also called special files).
	•	In Linux, everything is a file – even hardware like disks, terminals, and printers.
	•	The files in /dev are interfaces to kernel drivers that let you interact with hardware or virtual devices.

You don’t directly “open” these files to edit them, but commands and programs can use them to send or receive data to/from hardware.

⸻

📂 Types of Device Files in /dev

There are 2 main types:
	1.	Character Devices (c)
	•	Data is handled one character at a time.
	•	Example: keyboards, mice, serial ports, terminals.
	•	✅ Found with ls -l showing a c at the start:

crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Jul 16 10:12 /dev/null

Block Devices (b)
	•	Data is handled in blocks (like disks).
	•	Example: hard drives, SSDs, USB drives.
	•	✅ Found with ls -l showing a b at the start:

brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Jul 16 10:12 /dev/sda

Key Special Files in /dev

Here’s a tour of the most common ones you’ll see:

File	What It Represents
/dev/null	A “black hole” – data written here is discarded (used to suppress output).
/dev/zero	Infinite stream of zeros. Useful for overwriting or allocating space.
/dev/random	Generates random data (good for cryptography).
/dev/urandom	Like /dev/random, but faster and less “truly random”.
/dev/tty	The terminal currently in use.
/dev/sda	The first hard disk (block device). Subsequent disks are /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.
/dev/sr0	First CD/DVD-ROM drive.
/dev/loop0	A loopback device (lets you mount a file as if it were a disk).
/dev/fd0	First floppy disk (mostly historical now).

Why is /dev special?
	•	Dynamic: Modern Linux uses udev, which populates /dev automatically as devices are added/removed.
	•	Virtual Filesystem: /dev isn’t a real directory on disk. It’s provided by the devtmpfs filesystem mounted at boot.

⸻

🖐️ Real-World Uses

✔ Suppressing Output

command > /dev/null 2>&1

(Send all output and errors to the void.)

Wiping a Drive

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M

(Overwrite /dev/sdb with zeros.)

Testing Randomness

head -c 100 /dev/random | od -t x1

Checking USB Device

dmesg | grep sdb
ls -l /dev/sd*



/boot directory

What is it?
	•	/boot contains all the files required for the system to boot up.
	•	Think of it as the launch chamber: without it, the dragon (Linux) never wakes.
	•	It’s small but absolutely critical—messing it up = unbootable system.

Full path:
/boot

What lives in /boot
File/Directory	What It Does
vmlinuz-*	Compressed Linux kernel (the core OS)
initrd.img-*	Initial RAM disk (used during early boot stages)
grub/	GRUB bootloader configs and modules
System.map-*	Kernel symbol table (for debugging and crash analysis)
config-*	Kernel build configuration

The asterisks (*) represent the kernel version (e.g., vmlinuz-5.15.0-1051).

Why is /boot Important?

✅ Without /boot, the system:
❌ can’t load the kernel
❌ can’t initialize hardware drivers
❌ can’t hand control to user space

It’s the first stage of resurrection for your Linux system.

That’s why sysadmins often separate /boot into its own partition for protection.

Real-World Examples
	
View the kernel version loaded:

uname -r

Inspect GRUB configuration (bootloader):

Check available kernels:

Update GRUB after kernel upgrade:

/tmp directory

What is /tmp?
	•	/tmp is a temporary directory where programs and users can store files that are only needed for a short time.
	•	Think of it as Linux’s scratchpad or a sandbox for temp files.

✅ Any user or program can write here (with some restrictions).

✅ It’s cleared out automatically, either:
	•	On reboot (in most distros)
	•	Or by tmpwatch / systemd-tmpfiles if a file is unused for too long.

⸻

🧑‍💻 Key Properties of /tmp
	•	🗑️ Ephemeral: Anything here is not meant to last. Don’t save important files here!
	•	👥 World-Writable: Any user can write here, but files are protected from other users by the sticky bit.
	•	That’s why you see permissions like this:

drwxrwxrwt 10 root root 4096 Jul 16 09:42 /tmp

•	t at the end = sticky bit (users can’t delete files they don’t own).

What Goes in /tmp?
	•	Programs use /tmp for:
	•	Temporary data while running
	•	Socket files for inter-process communication (IPC)
	•	Lock files
	•	Cache files during installations

Examples:

File	Purpose
/tmp/tmp1234.txt	User-created temp file
/tmp/.X11-unix	Sockets for X Window system
/tmp/pulse-PKdhtXMmr18n	Audio server (PulseAudio) socket folder
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXX/	Temporary directory for SSH keys

Sticky Bit in Action

To see it:

ls -ld /tmp

You’ll get:

drwxrwxrwt 10 root root 4096 Jul 16 09:42 /tmp

The t at the end means:
	•	Users can’t delete files they don’t own.

Without sticky bit? Any user could delete anyone else’s temp files 🫠.

Security Notes

✔️ Modern Linux mounts /tmp with noexec and nosuid to prevent abuse:
	•	noexec: Stops programs from running directly from /tmp.
	•	nosuid: Stops set-user-ID programs from escalating privileges.


⸻

🖐️ Real-World Uses

Quick Scratch File

cd /tmp
echo "test" > testfile.txt

Temporary Download

wget -O /tmp/testfile.zip http://example.com/file.zip

Debugging
Programs often leave traces in /tmp when they fail.

tmp vs /var/tmp

Directory	Cleared When?	Use Case
/tmp	On reboot	Short-lived temp files
/var/tmp	Sticks around between reboots	Longer-lived temp fi
